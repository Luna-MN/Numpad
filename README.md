# Numpad
*this is a finished project and will not be updated*

This is a game I made based entirly on the numpad
feel free to edit/clone it for your own projects
## How To Play

Use the 1-9 + 0 and fullstop keys, click the correct key that is highlighted, if you press the wrong key you will lose a life, if the timer runs out it's game over
